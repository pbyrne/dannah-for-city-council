The City of Roseville currently has a Volunteer Coordinator which is responsible for planning and hosting events for residents. As a Council Member, I will work to ensure the expansion of the Volunteer Coordinator’s role.

Areas of expansion for the Volunteer Coordinator will include police and community outreach and trust building; Small Business assistance and resource workshops; Sustainable education workshops for all residents; job training and resource outreach, assistance, and advocacy; housing and job resources for those with Section 8 and criminal backgrounds; and lastly assist in community outreach focused towards increasing civic participation and input.
