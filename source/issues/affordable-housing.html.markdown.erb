As a council member, I will be an advocate for the homeless through my policy goals of pushing ourselves and our neighboring cities to eliminate all homelessness by 2027.

Indigenous, People of Color, and LGBTQIA have been disproportionately affected by housing disparities. Many are left vulnerable to gaps in fair housing protections and criminal records, for which time has been served. With the following policy goals I will work to ensure housing in Roseville, whether renting or buying, is first and foremost attainable:

### Establish a community advisory board

The board will focus on addressing homelessness and affordable housing for residents and the elderly. As the city is host to many advocates who work with vulnerable communities in Roseville they have valuable experiences and recommendations for improvements. The Board will provide feedback on policy topics and will assist in the establishment of a network of support available for residents and non-residents alike.

### Expand protections for renters and workers

Expand protections from discrimination based on LGBTQIA status and criminal background history. Felons who have served time for an offense often face difficulties getting into the work force and housing because of their criminal record. I plan to work towards eliminating the criminal background requirement on rental applications and establish guidelines for when it is necessary on job applications. Exceptions will be recommended by the Advisory Board and decided upon by the Council and Mayor. I will also work towards waivers for rental application fees within Roseville for those living in poverty and a $15 an hour minimum wage.

Additionally, I will work to ensure an increase in available housing for residents receiving Section 8. Ensuring a stable home is the first step in a familyâ€™s success and we must actively work to ensure all residents are provided with the best opportunities to succeed. Through mandatory Section 8 acceptance and partnerships with our many property owners we can take the first step towards progress.

As a final step towards protecting renters, I will fight for a Just Cause Ordinance for renters on month-to-month leases and ensure a grievance process in effect for residents facing harassment or discrimination by landlords.

### Network of support

which will include resources for services to help those off of the streets. Resources for renters are completely missing from the Roseville website. Resources will include information on community members and organizations who assist in record expungement, resume writing, and resources for GED Programs, Trade Schools and College/University enrollment, felony housing in Roseville/Twin Cities, database of jobs.

### Community efforts to assist the homeless

Such efforts include community gardens and a City of Roseville donation drive. I will work to ensure Community Gardens are available for all community members, but also utilize them with the goal of supporting families living in poverty and those living on the streets who have been turned away from homeless shelters, or have no access to such assistance. The donation drive will work to distribute food, clothing, and blankets to those living on the streets. By working directly with those affected by homelessness, Roseville can connect directly with individuals who may not be a part of the system of shelters or organizations already in existence.

### Ensure our elders can age in Roseville

Provide our elder population with options available when it comes to downsizing. Part of my Affordable Housing plan will undoubtedly include the needs of our eldest residents. Ensuring they can continue to call Roseville home while also remaining a part of our community is very important to me. As a Council Member I will ensure residents can downsize into condos, town homes, apartments, and senior facilities. Supporting mixed use properties also allows complexes to support families and the elderly generations alike.
