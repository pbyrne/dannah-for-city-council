Luxury development and ‘chic’ neighborhoods have caused rent hikes in the Metro area and Rosedale Mall offer  mainstream variety for residents, but it is missing small businesses which more directly contribute to Roseville’s economy. Luxury development and conglomerations likes malls bankrupt and displace small businesses owned by minorities, people of color, and women.  I will work to ensure protections for communities against luxury developers and promoting the growth of small businesses by:

I. Adopt an Urban Policy Agenda  which Endorses:
1. The development of small diversified rental units which are a safeguard against expensive rents and potential increases in property taxes.
2. Multiple-Use renovations, as needed, of public spaces and new development which will have a variety of small businesses and housing. The Multiple-Use urban design demonstrates that areas comprised of residences and businesses leads to safer neighborhoods.

II. Community Education such as community classes to teach POCI (People of Color and Indigenous) and especially women of color the process of owning a business and what resources are available.  These classes can include topics such as Business Taxes 101 and Applying and Qualifying for loans and grants. Increasing the number of POCI owned businesses allows for an active investment in our communities most often affected by luxury developments and urban renewal.

II. Increase Partnerships and City Relationships focused on expanding and growing Small Businesses and Business owned by POCI). If elected, I will work with our Economic Development Authority to establish relationships with the Black Chamber of Commerce, Metropolitan Economic Development Association, our two school boards, and banks/microbanks focused on supporting small businesses owned by women and POCI.

III. Ensure zoning codes are designed to promote the success our businesses through mixed-use neighborhoods and walkable districts in areas such as the Twin Lakes Parkway, Rice and Larpenteur, Har-Mar Mall, and Rosedale Mall. As a Council Member, I will ensure all development plans for these areas are decided with our small business owners in mind.
