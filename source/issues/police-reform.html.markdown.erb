With the increased coverage of police conduct, Roseville has held sessions for community input yet it has yielded few improvements.  To ensure the full prosperity of our community we must first recognize the institutional racism that is holding us back. This must begin with police reform and the ceasing of the school-to-prison-pipeline. I will do this through direct invitation to community members and grassroots organizers with the following policy goals:

### Establish a Community Advisory Board on Police Reform

The board's objective will be to provide recommendations and input for the utilization of mental health professionals in response to mental health calls. The board will also advise on training curriculums for police regarding appropriate responses to mental health crises.

The board will be composed of community leaders/grassroots organizers, mental health professionals, non profit organizations, and police professionals. The committee will also work to hold the City accountable for reaching solutions, and recommend partnerships with other cities working towards meaningful police reform.

### Establish De-Escalation Policies

1. Development of a community program for children, teens, and the Roseville Police Department. I would like to see this partnership established with the support of our community and the Parks and Recreation Board.
2. Work to designate weapon-free response situations and/or teams beginning with calls where violence, or the threat of violence is missing; suspect lacks any violent crime background; routine traffic stops; where mental health is involved.
3. Research the effectiveness of rebuilding community trust through neighborhood foot patrols versus patrolling in the vehicle.
4. Expand Rosevilleâ€™s traffic-stop data to encompass all police arrests. This will allow future analysis of patterns and statistics regarding many demographics allowing Roseville to accurately address patterns of discrimination.
5. Establish new designations for fineable offenses versus arrestable offenses, in addition to working with City officials to de-escalate police enforcement efforts regarding  possession of marijuana, while enforcing increased penalties for texting and driving and not pulling over for emergency vehicles.
