Becoming stewards in Environmental Sustainability has already begun in Roseville. From their zero waste options used for community events and the restoration of Minnesota’s habitats, Roseville has been a leader in the Metro Area.  I will work towards long term goals of sustainability by engaging my colleagues, residents and businesses in going green through the following objectives:

### Investment in Alternative Energy and Green Infrastructure

1. By investing in Solar Co-ops or Farms Roseville could soon provide solar energy throughout neighborhoods and businesses. By working with and expanding our current partnerships in Roseville, we can evaluate our most affordable and efficient options.
2. Work with the Metropolitan Council to offer additional bus routes to service all of Roseville as an alternative to park and rides which can be inaccessible and as far removed as the bus routes.

### Community Accountability

I will work to ensure all residents have access to services that can help reduce their carbon footprint by:

1. Placing compost bins in public locations such as Community Gardens which encourage participation and allow residents an alternative to fertilizers and other harmful chemicals in their gardens.
2. Work with our recycling partnership to provide recycling for plastic bags. This service would be provided door to door as it is with recycling glass or bottles.
3. Work to eliminate and replace the use of plastic bags in stores.
4. Offer recognition for environmentally responsible businesses by expanding the  Roseville model already available to residents. This will allow businesses will to actively contribute to Roseville’s sustainability efforts.

### Community Education

Information is often the biggest barrier to making individual improvements, yet it is these improvements that can have the biggest impact on our environment.  Establishing community classes and workshops will allow Roseville to teach homeowners about sustainability on topics such as: Rainwater Gardens, Wildflower Gardens to support Bee populations, how to switch to alternative sources of energy, and how to increase your homes energy efficiency in Minnesota’s weather extremes.
