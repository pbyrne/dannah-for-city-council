In order to address the population of our deer effectively and humanely, I support Immuno-Contraception rather than continued controlled kills. The City has so far done two controlled kills, and it certainly will not be the last â€“ even with a feeding ban in effect!

Immuno-Contraception is 90% effective in preventing pregnancy and preliminary studies support longevity in sustainable deer populations. Contraception is non-invasive as it is delivered by tranquilizer like darts and there are no known health risks.
Immuno-Contraception is preferred by several agencies including the Humane Society, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and the Institute of Health.

In the long term, the price of the contraceptive (which can now last up to 3 years) is fiscally sustainable compared to the costs (on a County/City level) to continually fund a controlled kill.  There are grants and several agencies willing to subsidize the costs if the City chooses to be a part of a research project focused on its effectiveness in curbing populations in the long term.
