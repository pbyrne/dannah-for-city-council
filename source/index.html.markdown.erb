## My vision for Roseville

As a Council Member I will work to strengthen our Community-City Relationship and return residents’ platform to effect change. Including the community in the decision making process will create a more innovative, equitable, and environmentally responsible Roseville. I believe the many needs facing our city are intersectional. I also believe the solutions are intersectional and creating policy with this in mind will help get to the root of our issues and bring forth positive change.

> I have set aggressive goals, because I believe in a future worth fighting for. I believe we are stronger when working together.

Through community input, collaboration, and action I envision the community of Roseville becoming leaders of the urban future where we help each other grow. I will bring forth policy ideas which protect our most vulnerable residents, push Roseville’s growth as a steward of environmental sustainability, and improve the accessibility, attainability, and affordability of renting or owning a home.

## About me

I am a descendant of the White Earth Reservation and I was raised in Northeast Minneapolis. I earned a Bachelors in Political Science with a minor in Justice and Peace Studies at the University of St. Thomas. I have worked at a small law firm in Downtown Minneapolis since 2010 where I am a Paralegal Supervisor. My husband Brett and I moved to Roseville in 2016 after rent continued to rise year after year.

Since moving to Roseville and running for City Council in 2017 I have joined the *Roseville Housing Network* created by former Mayor of Roseville Craig Klausing. It is a community driven network of individuals committed to supporting affordable housing at its many stages of development.

> I have always believed in direct action and community engagement.

I have written and called representatives, attended city council meetings, and I have protested US military intervention, police violence, and unjust, inequitable policy decisions.

I decided to begin my campaign to ensure our residents are protected from inflating rents, that property taxes are used responsibly, and so we have a future that is brighter than our past. As a Council Member I will listen to your voices and I will value and ask for your input.  With your support I promise to work hard, be dedicated, and lead us to a Roseville which grows stronger together.
