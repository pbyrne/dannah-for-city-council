## My Vision for Roseville

<%= image_tag "dannah-portrait.jpg", class: "inset inset-right" %> After living in Minneapolis for 7 years in my first apartment, I moved to Roseville with my husband in March of 2017 as an escape from South Minneapolis’ rising rents. While it was a difficult decision to leave Minneapolis, I have been warmly embraced as a member of the community.

There are many issues facing the suburban areas of the Twin Cities as rents rise, neighborhoods gentrify, and people seek a new home close to their roots.  I believe the many needs facing our City are intersectional. I also believe the solutions are intersectional and creating policy with this in mind can help get to the root of our issues and bring forth positive change.

I envision the community of Roseville becoming leaders of the urban future where we help each other grow.  I will bring forth policy ideas which protect our most vulnerable residents, continue Roseville’s growth as a steward of environmental sustainability, and improve accessibility, attainability, and affordability of renting  or owning a home.

As a council member, I will work towards these policy principals by including the residents of Roseville. I believe there are many organizations and individuals working towards a better Roseville and I wish to return their platform to effecting change through community input, collaboration, and action.
