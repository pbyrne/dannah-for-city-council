## My vision for Roseville

<%= image_tag "dannah-portrait.jpg", class: "inset inset-right" %> After living in Minneapolis for 7 years in my first apartment, I moved to Roseville with my husband in March of 2017 as an escape from South Minneapolis’ rising rents. While it was a difficult decision to leave Minneapolis, I have been warmly embraced as a member of the community.

There are many issues facing the suburban areas of the Twin Cities as rents rise, neighborhoods gentrify, and people seek a new home close to their roots.  I believe the many needs facing our City are intersectional. I also believe the solutions are intersectional and creating policy with this in mind can help get to the root of our issues and bring forth positive change.

I envision the community of Roseville becoming leaders of the urban future where we help each other grow.  I will bring forth policy ideas which protect our most vulnerable residents, continue Roseville’s growth as a steward of environmental sustainability, and improve accessibility, attainability, and affordability of renting  or owning a home.

As a council member, I will work towards these policy principals by including the residents of Roseville. I believe there are many organizations and individuals working towards a better Roseville and I wish to return their platform to effecting change through community input, collaboration, and action.

## About me

### Family

I come from a large modern family where I have three younger brothers, a cousin who was raised like a brother, and a step-mom. I am a descendant of the White Earth Reservation, where I also met my husband 9 years ago.  Through my family I have overcome all of life’s challenges, while learning the values of hard work, kindness, and community.

### School

I attended Minneapolis Public Schools my entire life. I graduated from Patrick Henry High School in 2008, where I was involved with creating the first online, daily school newspaper. I was a member of  a student-led grant council and a student written newspaper, both of which promoted the visions of students through art, organizations, and written word. I also attended two Service Learning Conferences, on behalf of Minneapolis Public Schools where I was able to be  both a presenter and a participant.
In my Senior year of High School, I was awarded with the President’s Volunteer Service Award and was recognized by the MN Dept. of Education’s for my Outstanding Contributions to Service Learning.

After graduating, I attended the University of St. Thomas where I earned my degree in Political Science with a minor in Justice and Peace Studies. It is here that I further developed my love for Political Theory and Social Justice as it offers a thoughtful reflection on our communities as they were and where they can go.  As a Freshman I participated in my first nonviolent protest in Georgia. From this experience I developed a yearning to always want to do more to help my community, but I have often believed it to be an uphill battle, wondering what impact I could truly make as an individual. That is why I decided to run for City Council with the dream of helping others like me make improvements for all of our community.

### Career

I am a Paralegal Supervisor at a private law firm, where I have worked for <%= (Date.today.year - 2010) %> years.  Through hard work, adaptability, and commitment I advanced positions, arriving at my current title. With the same dedication and leadership that I had all my life, I promise to bring forth policies which will help Roseville grow together.
